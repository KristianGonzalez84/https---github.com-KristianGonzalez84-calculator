# BACKEND CALCULATOR!

## Used ExpressJS, NodeJS, Sequelize and MySQL Workbench 8.0 ##

can be used in url web browser or Postman ( I prefer Postman ).

# In Postman set it to 'POST' then http://localhost:3000/signup for signup first and in body use:
{
  "name": "****",
  "email": "****",
  "password": "****"
}

# This is to sign in, and then to perform:
- add,
- divide,
- multiply,
- subtract

In Postman use 'GET' ( leave the body with the credentials you used to sign in ), 
then use the endpoint like this: 
- ../add/ for example 2/2 and 'SEND' and you get back the result..
- ../divide/2/5 ....
- ../multiply/6/3 ... and so on!

  # Have fun! if any questions don't hesitate to ask ! #
